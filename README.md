## About
**Valden** - is a game about the trials that your hero will have to go through. We do not promise you, and we do not expect anything unusual from ourselves. This game is more *experience* in gamedev than a project with a successful future. But until today the development has not stopped, and it means something.

## Reuirements
If you have any problems with the startup, we recommend downloading and installing [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

## Source code
This is **not** an open-source project, but you can ask how this or that works. Perhaps, the whole source code will be opened after the final release *(v1.0.0)*. But maybe not.
